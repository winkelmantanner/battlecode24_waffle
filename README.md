This is my bot for Battlecode 2024, my fifth year doing Battlecode.  As in 2022 and 2023, I was only eligible for the two sprint tournaments.  But unlike those two years, this year I took time off from work to do Battlecode.  That means this bot had more effort put into it than the previous two years.  I did not update this bot after sprint tournament 2.

This year's game gets a 5-star rating from me.  It was a capture-the-flag game, where victory is achieved by capturing the flags of the opponent.  The game seemed better designed and implemented that the games of 2021, 2022, and 2023.

So what does this bot do?
Probably the most unusual thing about this bot is that when it has the flag, it retraces its own footsteps to get to wherever it spawned.  This had pros and cons.  The pro was that it never gets stuck in corners, and it tends to avoid the enemy.  The con is that it doesn't go for the nearest friendly spawn zone, and it often goes on long detours.  Also, I tried making it go for a friendly spawn zone if it sees that it can reach it, but this made it perform worse against the previous version of itself.

Also, when I first submitted this bot on Monday, January 8, 2024 at 8:50 PM CST, it was the first competitor submission of Battlecode 2024.

This bot appeared in [2024 Sprint Tournament 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUa2qQzUgmI) and [2024 Sprint Tournament 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqW-PZe-7Pc).
